#Emotion Analyzer using Audio Input üéôÔ∏è
#This project is an Emotion Analyzer that utilizes audio input to detect emotions. The application leverages Python with Tkinter for the graphical user interface and various libraries for audio processing and machine learning to analyze the emotional tone of the audio input. The aim is to provide an easy-to-use tool for analyzing emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more based on a user‚Äôs voice.

Features
Real-Time Audio Capture: Records audio directly from the microphone.
Emotion Detection: Identifies emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive GUI built using Tkinter.
Visualization of Results: Displays detected emotion and confidence level.
